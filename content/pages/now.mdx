Here are some of the things I’m currently focused on.

**Last updated:** February 2020.

## Work

I've just spent a couple of weeks redesigning my website and at the same time I switched from Jekyll to Gatsby. You can read more about that on the [versions](/versions/) page.

In my day job I'm currently learning about Adobe Campaign while working on a project for a large tourism company in Switzerland. I'm also working on a project for BP, developing some forms in React for their fuel automation process.

## Reading

I've been reading [Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant](https://amzn.to/2Jgo3Z4) by Robert Kiyosaki for a while now. Progress has been slow, but I'm going to stick with it.

Check out more of the books I like on [my Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/ajaykarwal).

## Watching

My wife and I are currently wathching [Power](https://www.netflix.com/title/70298433) on Netflix.

I also just finished Season 1 of [Altered Carbon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2261227/). It's a crime thriller set in the distant future where people's consciousness can be transfered to different bodies, esentially making them immortal.
