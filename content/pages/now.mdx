Here are some of the things I’m currently focused on.

**Last updated:** April 2020.

## Work
I've just spent a couple of weeks redesigning my website and at the same time I switched from Jekyll to Gatsby. You can read more about that on the [versions](/versions/) page.

In my day job I'm currently learning about Adobe Campaign while working on a project for a large tourism company in Switzerland. I'm also working on a project for BP, developing some forms in React for their fuel automation process.

## Reading
I've been reading [Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant](https://amzn.to/2Jgo3Z4) by Robert Kiyosaki for a while now. Progress has been slow, but I'm going to stick with it.

## Watching
I'm currently watching [Money Heist](https://www.netflix.com/title/80192098) on Netflix. It's a decent show but I find it annoying to watch because the audio is dubbed. I'd much prefer the original spanish audio and just have to read the subtitles.

## Gaming
I recently reached [100% completion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/g44qc1/this_is_both_satisfying_and_quite_upsetting/) on The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Took me a little over 180 hours of game play but it was totally worth it!

I'm really excited to see what the sequel to Breath of the Wild has to offer. Bring it on!
